#light-responsive
================

Super lightweight framework to make a rapid prototype with no "stuff", just whole width and half width grid.

##Usage

Use rows to create new lines.

    <div class="row"> content </div>

Use whole to create 100% width section 

    <div class="whole"> full width </div>

Use half to create a half width section 

    <div class="half"> left side </div>

Finish out the second half by including *to be modified

    <div class="half last"> right side </div>

### That's all. Customize to your heart's content. This just makes life easy.

All is written in hard CSS, sass or less your customizations if you wish.
